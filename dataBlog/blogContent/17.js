<p><span><span><span><span>Long-term loans are a significant financial tool for businesses looking to expand and develop. In South Africa, where the economic landscape is both dynamic and challenging, these loans can play a crucial role in fostering business growth. Understanding their impact can help entrepreneurs make informed decisions about financing their ventures.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span>Understanding Long-Term Loans</span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><a href="https://depfinfinance.co.za/about" style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline"><strong><span><span>Long-term loans</span></span></strong></a><span><span> are financial agreements where funds are borrowed for a period exceeding one year. These loans are typically used for substantial investments such as buying equipment, expanding facilities, or funding major projects. Unlike short-term loans, which are repaid within a year, long-term loans offer extended repayment periods, often ranging from 5 to 20 years.</span></span></span></span></p>
