<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="color:black">Block listing is a significant restriction obstacle to overcome when small business owners and entrepreneurs in South Africa search for financial assistance. While there are several alternative lending solutions, traditional lenders still need to steer clear of the prospects with lousy credit.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size:16.0pt"><span style="color:black">Understanding block listing</span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="color:black">But before we get into the alternatives, it&#39;s essential to grasp what being blocked means. In </span></span><a href="https://depfinfinance.co.za/" style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline"><strong><span style="font-size:12.0pt">South Africa, block listing</span></strong></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="color:black"> usually implies a bad credit rating because of missed payments or defaulting on debts. Even with such a poor history, qualifying for regular loans from banks and other traditional financial institutions can be challenging.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size:16.0pt"><span style="color:black">Alternative Lending Options</span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="color:black">Microfinance Institutions</span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="color:black">With a mission of providing financial services to underprivileged entrepreneurs and small businesses, MFIs were launched. Instead, these organizations center their attention on the business idea of an applicant&#39;s creditworthiness and potential for growth -not just its credit history. Blocked entrepreneurs who require seed capital or working capital may also be able to borrow against microloans from MFIs.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="color:black">Peer-to-Peer Lending</span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="color:black">P2P or Peer-to-Peer lending platforms link borrowers with individual investors willing to provide funds for their loans. P2P lenders circumvent the entrenched house of the financial system, offering a more lenient borrowing model. You can find more sympathy from the entrepreneur/investor side on these platforms. As a result, blocked borrowers may feel like they fit in better than before, causing investors to often not care about credit scores only.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="color:black">Invoice Financing</span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="color:black">With invoice financing or accounts receivable financing, as it is also known, businesses can receive a cash advance on the invoices they are set to have gone out. This type of funding is especially beneficial for companies that have slow-paying clients. These entrepreneurs, while blocked and as such, cannot gain access to credit through traditional methods due to their adverse financial behavior; the type of security that comes with invoice financing (since it is sourced against invoices) would make for a suitable alternative.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="color:black">Asset-Based Lending</span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="color:black">In this case, the creditor extends a loan against tangible assets such as property, equipment, or inventory.

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size:16.0pt"><span style="color:black">Free Money and Subsidy from the Government</span></span></strong></span></span></p>

Most grants are issued for a purpose specified by the issuing government, which could relate to business development, innovation, etc. As grants, they do not have a repayment like loans, but obtaining these grants usually means an application has a checklist of conditions that need to be fulfilled.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="color:black">Crowdfunding</span></span></strong></span></span></p>

Not just financially, it also serves as a way to check for enough interest in the general public in your business idea. Crowdfunding platforms (for example, Kickstarter and Indiegogo) enable the showcase of their projects to potential backers in return for rewards or, in some cases, shares.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="color:black">Trade Credit</span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="color:black">Trade credit is a type of short-term financing where suppliers provide goods or services on credit, and businesses only have to pay for them at an agreed-upon future date. Anonymity: This can also be an excellent way for blocked enterprises to control their cash flow without approaching traditional lenders and securing immediate finance. Strong supplier relationships can also improve your credit terms and trading prospects.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="color:black">Family and Friends</span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="color:black">Without following the right channels, this may not constitute a proper lending avenue; family and friends as lenders will also be suitable for blocked entrepreneurs. This usually entails repayment terms that are more flexible and such qualification criteria being less rigid. Of course, you will have to follow that with a caveat explaining the requisite levels of communication and documentation so as not to leave room for confusion.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="color:black">It may be the case you have poor credit scores; however, keeping transparent financial records or showing cash flow could improve your credibility.
