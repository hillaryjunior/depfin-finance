        including specifically its approval, but it delegates certain
        responsibilities to the financial Manager, key individuals and to the
        compliance officer as set out below.
    </p>
    <p>
        4.2 The Directors are responsible for drafting and implementation of
        this Policy as well as for its consideration and approval. The
        Directors should ensure that all employees, representatives and where
        appropriate, associates, are made aware of the contents of this Policy
        , which will include the training and education on this policy. The
        Directors must also ensure that this Policy is always available upon
        request and that it is easily accessible for public inspection at all
        reasonable times.
    </p>
    <p>
        4.3 Specifically in relation to the FAIS Act, the Key Individuals (KIs)
        are responsible for managing or overseeing the activities of the Depfin
        FSP with respect to the rendering of financial services. In terms of
        Depfin, the KIs are also employees of the business. The
        responsibilities of the KIs in terms of this Policy are the same as
        those of the Management team as set out above, albeit with specific
        focus on the aspects that fall under the ambit of the FAIS Act,
        including but not limited to the below tasks:
    </p>
    <p>
        4.3.1 The KI is tasked with keeping all the signed declaration forms
        completed by employees and or by representatives on behalf of Depfin
        and in addition, copies of the conflicts of interest forms.
    </p>
    <p>
        4.3.2 The KI is to maintain the conflicts of interest register on
        behalf of Depfin. Details of all the declaration forms and conflict of
        interest forms will be recorded, updated and reported monthly to the
        Management team.
    </p>
    <p>
        4.4 The Compliance Officer is responsible for the following:
    </p>
    <p>
        reporting in the annual compliance reports submitted to the Registrar
        of Financial Services Providers under the FAIS Act that must deal with
        the monitoring of, compliance with and accessibility of this Policy;
    </p>
    <p>
        maintaining a conflicts of interest management register into which all
        declaration forms completed by employees and representatives are
        recorded;
    </p>
    <p>
        assist the Management team in discharging its responsibilities
        including arranging appropriate training of employees and
        representatives.
    </p>
    <p>
        4.5 Every employee must communicate and disclose any personal interests
        they may have to Depfin in the prescribed format. This includes any
        affiliation and nepotism as defined, which may cause an actual or
        perceived conflict of interest or could impair or be perceived to
        impair their ability to act with integrity or objectivity in the
        context of their employment.
    </p>
    <p>
        4.6 All employees must complete an annual declaration disclosing
        personal interests including those that may be pre-existing that may
        cause an actual or perceived conflict of interest. Notwithstanding the
        fact that an employee may already have made one or more disclosures in
        the months preceding the receipt of their annual declaration form, they
        will still be required to complete an annual declaration form. If
        employees have nothing to declare, they will need to complete a nil
        declaration.
    </p>
    <p>
        4.6.1 Disclosures made by employees (refer above) are to be considered
        by the Key Individual and where necessary the KI will refer any
        declarations to the Compliance Officer. The declarations are to be
        assessed in accordance with the requirements set out in this Policy and
        the transaction or activity related thereto must be approved and or
        declined, which decision will be communicated to the employee in
        writing.
    </p>
    <p>
        4.7 Once a representative has identified a conflict of interest (refer
        to above), the representative must report the conflict to the KI of
        Depfin. The report is to be made in the prescribed format and is to be
        used by the KI to update Depfin conflicts of interest register.
    </p>
    <p>
        4.7.1 All conflicts of interest that are reported by Reps are to be
        considered by the KI and are to be used to update the conflicts of
        interest management register. In certain instances, the Compliance
        Officer may refer certain reports to the Management team. The reports
        should be assessed in accordance with this Policy and any feedback
        communicated to the representative in writing.
    </p>
    <p>
        5. IDENTIFICATION OF A CONFLICT OF INTEREST
    </p>
    <p>
        Given the nature and complexity of the business activities in the
        provision of financial services and products, a number of mechanisms
        have been identified that can be utilised to identify potential
        conflicts of interest:
    </p>
    <p>
        All employees, representatives and KIs are to be trained on the content
        of this Policy and will be made aware of the obligation to identify
        specific circumstances that may give rise to conflicts of interest;
    </p>
    <p>
        In the event that they become aware of a conflict of interest, all
        employees, representatives and KIs are to follow the processes set out
        in this document in terms of disclosures and or declarations;
    </p>
    <p>
        The statutory disclosure notices have been enhanced and set out
        important information which, when read by clients, can assist in
        identification of potential conflicts of interest especially relating
        to associates;
    </p>
    <p>
        The roles and responsibilities expected from the various parties are
        clearly set out in this Policy including those of employees,
        representatives, KIs, Compliance Officer, Management team and the Board
        of Directors.
    </p>
    <p>
        6. MEASURES TO AVOID CONFLICT OF INTEREST
    </p>
    <p>
        It is noted that Depfin FSP does not have any ownership interest in a
        third party. The following measures have been implemented to avoid
        conflict of interests:
    </p>
    <p>
        No person may offer or provide a sign-on bonus to any person, other
        than a new entrant, as an incentive to become a Category I provider
        that is authorised or appointed to give advice;
    </p>
    <p>
        A category I provider that is authorised or appointed to give advice
        may not receive a sign-on bonus from any person;
    </p>
    <p>
        Avoid any situations in terms of which, when conducting business with a
        client, objectivity may be impaired;
    </p>
    <p>
        In the event there is a pre-existing financial interest which may
        result in a conflict of interest with a client or prospective client,
        it be disclosed and or declared immediately;
    </p>
    <p>
        In the event that there is a pre-existing ownership interest which may
        result in a conflict of interest with a client or prospective client,
        it must disclosed and/or declared immediately;
    </p>
    <p>
        Ensure that all training is attended that may be provided from time to
        time relating to conflicts of interest and actively familiarise
        yourself with the content of this Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        7. MEASURES TO MITIGATE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
    </p>
    <p>
        7.1 Depfin will avoid conflicts of interest as far as reasonably
        possible. However, where this is not possible, the conflict of
        interests must be mitigated and managed in accordance with the below
        guideline:
    </p>
    <p>
        Follow the process set out in this Policy regarding disclosures,
        declarations and any guidance that may be issued following the
        assessment of any disclosure/declaration;
    </p>
    <p>
        Follow the process in relation to always providing clients with the
        requisite statutory disclosure notices;
    </p>
    <p>
        In the event that a conflict of interest is identified, it must be
        disclosed to the client in writing at the earliest reasonable
        opportunity (refer below for further details);
    </p>
    <p>
        Clients are to be informed of the existence of this Policy and the
        manner in which it may be accessed;
    </p>
    <p>
        All staff, representatives and KIs will be provided with a copy of this
        Policy and will be required to sign an acknowledgement of receipt and
        declaration that they will familiarise themselves with its content;
    </p>
    <p>
        The Compliance Officer will add the monitoring of employees,
        representatives and KIs to this Policy to Depfin annual compliance
        monitoring plan.
    </p>
    <p>
        7.2 In the event that a conflict of interest is identified, it must be
        disclosed to the client in writing at the earliest reasonable
        opportunity including specifically:
    </p>
    <p>
        the measures taken in accordance with this Policy to avoid or mitigate
        the conflict;
    </p>
    <p>
        any ownership or financial interest that the representatives or
        provider may be or become eligible for (other than immaterial financial
        interest);
    </p>
    <p>
        the nature of the relationship or arrangement with a third party that
        gives rise to the conflict in sufficient detail to enable the client to
        understand it.
    </p>
    <p>
        7.3 The process described above is to be followed in all instances
        where a conflict of interest has been identified, irrespective of the
        fact that a client may have been provided with the statutory
        disclosures (in other words, the written disclosure above is to be
        supplied to a client in addition to any standard statutory disclosure
        notice).

        financial interest, is paid by that provider or representative at the
        time of receipt thereof.
    </p>
    <p>

        cheque or in some instances annual performance bonuses that recognise
        their contribution to the overall performance of Depfin. Salaries are
        paid in accordance with employment contracts and in instances where a
        representative is paid a performance bonus, in all instances it will be
        calculated based on a formula, which includes the net profit
        performance of Depfin and the overall performance appraisal of the
        individual concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
